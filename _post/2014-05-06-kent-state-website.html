<p>The new <a href="http://www.kent.edu">www.kent.edu</a> launched on May 4, 2014, refreshing the Kent State home page, all of our top-level sections and Undergraduate Admissions.  The next phases of the website will launch throughout 2014.  Below, I'll take you some of the coolest features of the new website.</p>
<h4>Home Page</h4>
<p>The new Kent State home page features large success story photos, a new infographics section for quickly finding out about Kent State, an integrated calendar, Where is Kent State - which shows off our regional and global campuses and a large footer, with contact information and social media icons.</p>
<h4>Landing Pages</h4>
<p>The redesigned landing pages tell Kent State's story through photos and briefly summarize the available areas within the website.  Landing pages include About, Academics, Admissions, Athletics, Research and Locations.</p>

<h4>Discover Kent State</h4>
<p><a href="http://www.kent.edu/go">Discover Kent State</a> is a completely new 3-page section dedicated to introducing prospective students to the Kent State campus, our surrounding town and area attractions outside of Kent.  Students are taken sequentially through each section, each of which was prepared with original content from our copywriting team.</p>
<h4>Basic Content Pages</h4>
<p>Basic content pages, such as Arts, present content in a easy-to-digest manner, with space for a feature photo and local navigation.</p>
<h4>Undergraduate Admissions</h4>
<p>The new <a href="http://www.kent.edu/admissions/undergraduate">undergraduate admissions website</a> uses the traditional version of the Kent State theme, with a reversed, white header and custom navigation that better signifies to the user which department they are currently browsing, but still captures Kent State's global elements, ensuring the user is never lost.</p>
