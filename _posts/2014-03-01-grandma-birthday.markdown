The Kent State University Athletics Annual Report is produced each year as a showcase for Athleticsâ€™ accomplishments throughout the year, and this year we produced it as a responsive web site.  I had the opportunity to work on the site with IdeaBase as a developer.  The site was recognized with a Silver ADDY at the Akron AAF ceremony in 2015 for Responsive Web Design.
