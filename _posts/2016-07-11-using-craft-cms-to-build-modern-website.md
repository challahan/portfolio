Building our latest web project within Craft CMS allowed the team to take advantage of complex content relationships and remix content in a variety of ways behind the web.  

I put together a 20 minute video webcast (below) demonstrating how each of the features were implemented behind the scenes.

Of, if you'd rather read, listed below are five features of Craft CMS that I feel helped speed up our development timeline and create an intuitive experience for our client.  The example website I'm using is for Reading Buzz, which you can visit at [www.readingbuzz.us](http://www.readingbuzz.us).

If you're not familiar with using Craft, check it out on [Craft's Website](http://www.craftcms.com).  Licenses are free for personal use and start go up to $299 for professional use.
