I presented my first workshop on responsive web design in June 2015.  Since then, I've given the talk a few times.

In the Responsive Web Design workshop, participants get an interactive overview of several key aspects of the responsive web design process. Designed to be accessible to users who are at a beginner or intermediate level, the responsive web design workshop concentrate on the following 3 key objectives:

* Understanding the content-first approach to developing websites within a content management system.
* Understanding what makes mobile-first, responsive websites work well through design thinking and code.
* Ensuring a user-centered design approach through user research and usability testing.
