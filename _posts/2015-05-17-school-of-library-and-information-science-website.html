<p>Completed in January 2015, the redesigned Kent State University School of Library and Information Science (SLIS) website was completed in partnership with IdeaBase, a student-run agency within the college.  It was the first custom-designed template to launch in Kent State's new Drupal content management system and features:</p>
<ul>
<li>A custom-designed theme that integrates the university's brand and web standards</li>
<li>New, rewritten content and navigation that better matches user needs discovered in the research phase</li>
<li>Mobile-first, responsive design</li>
</ul>
<p>I acted as lead developer on the site and also participated in the user research and design process.</p>
