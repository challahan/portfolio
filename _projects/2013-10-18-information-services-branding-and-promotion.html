<p>The Fall 2012 semester brought more advertising opportunities for Information Services.  Our goal this semester was to spread the message about the great services offered by IS that students, faculty and staff use every day.  In addition, we launched a redesigned Online Technology Help Center with similar branding.  I was able to experiment some new forms of media as well.  The fall 2012 package included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Print ads in the student magazines</li>
<li>Newspaper ad in the Daily Kent Stater</li>
<li>Banner ad on the top of the Kent Wired mobile application for Android and iOS</li>
<li>A 30 second pre-roll before all videos on Kent Wired</li>
<li>A redesigned Online Technology Help Center featuring the Tech Help branding and a newer (and cleaner) user interface</li>
</ul>
