<p>The Kent State Mobile Apps showcase features Kent State's library of mobile applications for tablets and smartphones. Â The responsive web page replaced an outdated website that did not work well on mobile devices, with a new, mobile-first design.</p>
<h3>Highlights</h3>
<ul>
<li>New, custom design that utilizes Kent State's new brand standards (colors, fonts and user interface elements)</li>
<li>Responsive design provides the best experience for tablets and smartphones, as well as desktop computers.</li>
<li>Device photo changes based on the size of the screen of the device (and device orientation) on which the site is currently being browsed (change your browser window size to see this in action)</li>
<li>Uses SVG icons instead to ensure fast performance and retina-ready graphics</li>
</ul>
