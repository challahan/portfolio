In this latest web project, I oversaw the process of some very talented studentsâ€™ design and development of the May Consulting Partners website.  May Consulting Partners provides coaching and leadership training to professional and individuals, and this is their first website. The project involved rebranding, design concepts, content strategy and development of a custom WordPress theme over the period of a few months.  I was especially pleased with the outcome of this project because I was able to work with and teach a student at IdeaBase the fundamental concepts of web design and development.

KEY FEATURES INCLUDE:

Mobile friendly, responsive template
Custom WordPress theme, built on the ZURB Foundation framework
Development of a custom WordPress installation with custom field types
A modern visual design, with eye-catching, full-screen imagery
