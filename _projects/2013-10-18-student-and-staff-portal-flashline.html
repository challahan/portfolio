<p>FlashLine is Kent State's student and staff portal. Â As a project lead for FlashLine's information architecture, I've worked with our faculty/staff tab and student tools tab to reorganize the content based on user testing, surveys and feedback.</p>
<h3>My role in this project:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Conducted user testing, interviews and surveys</li>
<li>Prepared low fidelity wireframes</li>
<li>Redesigned the content in our portal's backend system</li>
<li>Monitored analytics and support requests to ensure success</li>
</ul>
