<p>As Kent State's first responsive website in the university's content management system, the JMC project was a huge undertaking. Â I collaborated with IdeaBase (student agency in downtown Kent), JMC faculty/staff and Information Services to launch the website on time, in just 7 months.</p>
<h3>My role in this project:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Developed the initial back-end template infrastructure that converted Kent State's static-width website into a responsive master template, using media queries and CSS</li>
<li>Worked with talented visual designers at IdeaBase to develop and approve web site designs that met Kent State's brand standards, but allowed for the creative individually that JMC sought</li>
<li>Codeveloped the site in Kent State's content management system with a designer from IdeaBase, hand-creating all CSS and building 6 master responsive templates in the CMS</li>
<li>Helped lead content development and content migration to the new CMS, ensuring content was consistent, met brand standards, was easy to find and read and was presented in vision with the designs</li>
<li>Conducted usability testing with several JMC classes and integrated feedback into designs</li>
<li>Successfully launched the new website on time and took part in the post-launch communications campaign</li>
<li>Measured analytics and implemented fixes that improved Internet Explorer and mobile device compatibility</li>
<li>Was awarded the "Friends of JMC" award in October 2013 for my work on the project</li>
</ul>
