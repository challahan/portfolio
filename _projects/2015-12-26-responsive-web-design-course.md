I designed the Responsive Web Design course for Kent State University's Colleg e of Communication and Information in Summer 2015.  The course debuted in the Fall '15 semester and was offered again for Spring '16.  We would like to continue offering this course, along with a more advanced, CMS-focused, version indefinitely.

The course was designed from the ground up to meet the student hunger for more practical, design-focused web courses in the college that were less purely technical (as others in other Colleges were).  The course also approaches web design from a mobile-first and content-first perspective, ensuring that designs are scaleable to and usable on any device.

As course designer and instructor, I led the:

* Creation of core learning objectives and syllabus
* Selection of ourse topics, schedule, readings and leading weekly lectures
* Criteria for assigments and semester-long course project
* Development of public course website and Blackboard Learning materials
* Organization of special speakers from the Responsive Web Design industry, including Karen McGrane and Ethan Marcotte.

Students had great feedback from the course, with some calling it "practical" and "one of the best courses they've taken at Kent State."  I plan to write a blog post discussing the positive (and negative) experiences with the new web design course.
