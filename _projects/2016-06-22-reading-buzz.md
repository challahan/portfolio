IdeaBase worked with Lindsey Buzzelli to design a website for her start-up business, Reading Buzz.  Reading Buzz provides video library lessons to school librarians and teachers.

I led the project from beginning to completion, ensuring a good user experience and developing the custom theme using Craft CMS.
