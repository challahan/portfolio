IdeaBase worked with Lindsey Buzzelli to design a website for her start-up business, Reading Buzz.  Reading Buzz provides video library lessons to school librarians and teachers.

I led the project from beginning to completion, ensuring designers, developers and content strategists designed for a great user experience.  I also concentrated on the front-end development of the custom theme using CraftCMS.

Some of the features of Reading Buzz include:

* A theme that includes templates that meet the needs of prospective customers (validated by usability testing and research)
* A custom-designed content management system, built for everyday use by our client
* Responsive design that works across multiple devices and platforms, including Google AMP and RSS
* A platform for displaying videos that automatically integrates with Vimeo
* An integrated email platform that integrates directly with the website's content itself
* Optimized performance and small pagesize (passes Google PageSpeed)
