IdeaBase was brought on board for the second year in a row to develop and design their year-in-review/annual report.  

The interactive report is designed in HTML/CSS and this year features a single-page design (with supplemental article pages).  The design is composed to photos, text and custom icons that match the university's blue and gold branding.  

As lead developer and UX designer on the project, I led the project team of account managers, developers, designers and also interfaced with the client, who wrote all of the content and provided the photos.  We went through a process of discovery, content gathering, design/architecture and development over a period of 5 months. 

From a technical perspective, the site utilizes:

* Jekyll, a static site generator that doesn't require a full content management system
* Grunt, for task running, including image resizing, brower refreshing and code compiling
* SASS for writing CSS for efficiently
* CSS animations
* Image and JavaScript compression and lazy loading for optimal performance

The site launched in September 2015.
