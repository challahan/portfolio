The redesigned website for IdeaBase, a student-powered design agency in Kent, OH, was launched in February 2016.

As front-end developer and user experience designer on the project, I worked with a talented team of designers and led the project from its initial proposal through launch, including:

* Developing initial sketches, sharing them with the designer and content strategist
* Working with student UX designers and content strategists to develop content, photography and information architecture
* Leading the implementation of a new content management system, Craft, and work with a student developer to write the PHP templates, stylesheets and JavaScript code
* Collaborating with the student visual designer to turn static templates and patterns into working front-end code
* Optimizing the website for optimal performance and accessibility
* Ensuring the site was usability tested with past clients and student employees
* Working with stakeholders within the organization as well as Kent State University to get feedback
* Setting up a public GitHub repository for the website and engaging the IT team in moving the site to a new web server with continuous integration
* Leading the creation of a [front-end style guide](http://www.ideabasekent.com/style) for both visual design and content
