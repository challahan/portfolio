IdeaBase partnered with Kent State University's Strategic Roadmap to a Distinctive Kent State.  This interactive roadmap was developed based on design concepts, photography and videography from University Communications and Marketing.  Working with a student web developer, we worked on the development and responsive implementation of the report, including:

* Writing all front-end HTML and SCSS
* Implementing third-party JavaScript for menus
* Organizing the content and layout structure of templates and content types
* Developing background auto-play videos optimized for accessibility
* Integrating CSS animations to draw attention to key content and page elements
* Testing front-end code for browser compatibility and performance
* Supervising the transition of the static templates into Jekyll and later, Drupal
* Working with the client and students on updates, changes and project management
