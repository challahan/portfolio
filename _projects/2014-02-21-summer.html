<p>Summer Sessions promotes the university's summer classes to both Kent State students and students from other schools.  The client proposed the need for an improved website that showed a clearer process for registering for summer sessions, reduced the extraneous navigation and links on their present site and showcased Kent State's campus and students, encouraging them to choose Kent State as their summer school destination, either online or in person.</p>
<p>Additionally, in conjunction with an accompanying campaign on Pandora and Spotify, I made the website responsive so that the information could easily be consumed on any device.</p>
<p>The new website is now available at <a href="http://www.kent.edu/summer">www.kent.edu/summer</a>, just in time for the beginning of summer registration.</p>
