<p>In this latest web project, I oversaw the process of some very talented students' design and development of the May Consulting Partners website.  May Consulting Partners provides coaching and leadership training to professional and individuals, and this is their first website. The project involved rebranding, design concepts, content strategy and development of a custom WordPress theme over the period of a few months.  I was especially pleased with the outcome of this project because I was able to work with and teach a student at IdeaBase the fundamental concepts of web design and development.</p>
<h3>Key Features Include:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Mobile friendly, responsive template</li>
<li>Custom WordPress theme, built on the ZURB Foundation framework</li>
<li>Development of a custom WordPress installation with custom field types</li>
<li>A modern visual design, with eye-catching, full-screen imagery</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you to the students who designed this website - I was glad to play a small part in its successful completion! <a id="more-button" href="http://mayconsultingpartners.com">View the finished website</a></p>
