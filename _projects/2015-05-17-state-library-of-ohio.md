I led the IdeaBase team that redesigned the State Library of Ohio website in May 2015.  The site features a new interface, improved site navigation, and enhanced search functionality.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeQZE5-ar3Q">View a video</a> to see the site in action, or visit the site to learn more.

My role included:

* Managing and leading the design and development teams to ensure the project ran smoothly
* Working with State Library of Ohio's on-site technical team to integrate with their systems
* Ensuring content was organized, edited and approved in an outside system before entering into the CMS
* Integrating the HTML/CSS design templates into WordPress PHP templates
* Working with our developer to buid out custom field and post types that matched the site's content
