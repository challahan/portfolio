<p>Email isn't dead yet.</p>
<p>Many academic and administrative departments at Kent State still find value and success in sending email marketing messages to students, faculty, staff and alumni.  My department commonly gets asked for advice on email marketing in a higher education environment.</p>
<p>I researched and prepared these <a href="http://www.kent.edu/about/administration/ur/ucm/services/comm/email-marketing.cfm">Guidelines for Email Marketing</a> for this very purpose.  While some of these recommendations may be specific to Kent State, those interested in these best practices may still find them interesting.  Additionally, other universities can easily adapt these guidelines to fit their needs.</p>
<p>I hope you learn something new about email marketing in higher education.  Thank you to MailChimp and Constant Contact for publishing some great research on the subject.</p>
