Completed in January 2015, the redesigned Kent State University School of Library and Information Science (SLIS) website was completed in partnership with IdeaBase, a student-run agency within the college.  It was the first custom-designed template to launch in Kent State’s new Drupal content management system and features:

* A custom-designed theme that integrates the university’s brand and web standards
* New, rewritten content and navigation that better matches user needs discovered in the research phase
* Mobile-first, responsive design

I acted as lead developer on the site and also participated in the user research and design process.
