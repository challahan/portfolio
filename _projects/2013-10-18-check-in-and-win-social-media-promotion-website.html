<p>The Check-In and Win Promotion took place at the kickoff of the fall 2013 semester at Kent State. The promotion encouraged new students to check in on Foursquare, Twitter and Instagram using #kent2017 and win prizes. My coworker Tim and I worked with 25 departments on campus to pull off the campaign.</p>
<h3>My role in this project:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Planned, develop ideas and formed the rules for the contest</li>
<li>Worked with departments to get them involved</li>
<li>Wrote tips, put together lists and added photos to our <a href="www.foursquare.com/kentstate">Foursquare site</a></li>
<li>Mocked up, developed and designed the website for the contest</li>
<li>Worked with designers to put together printed promotional materials</li>
<li>Promoted the event to students at tables on campus</li>
<li>Examined and reported on analytics and statistics related to the project</li>
</ul>
