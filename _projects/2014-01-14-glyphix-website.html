<p>Glyphix is a student-staffed design studio within the School of Visual Communication Design at Kent State University.  I worked with the Glyphix class to turn their design concepts and wireframes into an HTML/CSS template, built into university's content management system.   The site launched in January 2014.</p>
<h3>My role in this project:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Used SASS/Bourbon to style the website, based on annotated Photoshop mockups provided to me by the class</li>
<li>Set up the templates in CommonSpot, the university's content management system</li>
<li>Integrated the photo galleries with Flickr, using the Galleria plugin</li>
<li>Guided the class through the process of content entry and architecture in the content management system</li>
</ul>
