<p>Kent State needed an updated way to display all of their social networks in one places to make it easier for users to connect with them. Â I worked with a vendor, who took care of the back-end development and CSS, based on my designs and wireframes.</p>
<h3>My role in this project:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Helped identify needs and goals of project</li>
<li>Developed initial wireframes needed for approval from management</li>
<li>Developed high fidelity wireframes based on feedback</li>
<li>Worked with photographers to capture the perfect photo for the landing page</li>
<li>Worked with developers to implement and test the designs</li>
</ul>
