<p>Blackstone LaunchPad, an entrepreneurship program for students, faculty and staff on Kent State's campus. Â LaunchPad approached me for a more modern design that conveyed the sensibility of a start-up, with better support for a multi-device user base.</p>
<h3>My role in this project:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Met with client and marketing project manager to develop redesign goals, after an analysis of existing analytics</li>
<li>Created low fidelity wireframes for small and large screen devices</li>
<li>Based on these wireframes, created high fidelity patterns (colors, navigation, typography, buttons, etc.)</li>
<li>Created custom stylesheets and new templates within Kent State's content management system</li>
<li>Assisted client with content development and migration to new website</li>
<li>Successfully tested and launched website in October 2013</li>
</ul>
