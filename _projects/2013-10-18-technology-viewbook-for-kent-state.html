<p>Each year, IS puts information for new students, faculty and staff to introduce them to technology at the university. Â For the 2012-13 publication, I decided to take things to the extreme, with a magazine-style "viewbook" designed to communicate the information in a meaningful and beautiful way.</p>
<h3>My role in this project:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Designed a custom InDesign template</li>
<li>Wrote the copy</li>
<li>Chose the look and feel of the final product</li>
<li>Worked with print vendors to ensure quality and proper distribution</li>
</ul>
<p>All new students and employees at Kent State will receive this book as their introduction to technology, and so far the response has been fantastic.</p>
