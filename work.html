<p>Hi There</p>

{% for projects in site.projects %}
	<a href="{{ projects.url }}"><img src="../assets/{{projects.thumbnail}}" />{{ projects.title }}</a>
{% endfor %}

<p>Please Note: I’ve worked with some very talented people on most of these projects, and I can’t thank them enough for their help with these collaborations. I’ve done my best to outline my role(s) within each project.</p>
